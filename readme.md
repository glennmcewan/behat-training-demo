# Behat Training
This is the repo created to demonstrate how we can use Behat on a very simple Laravel 5 todo app.

- `git clone`
- `composer install`
- Set DB credentials in `.env` file
- `php artisan migrate`

To run Behat tests:
`vendor/bin/behat`

## TODO
Write up instructions on how to set up Selenium.
